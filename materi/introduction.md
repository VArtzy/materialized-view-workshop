# Materialized Views

## Introduction: Performance Optimization Through Pre-Computation
**What are Materialized Views?**  
Materialized views are database objects that store the results of a query physically, enabling faster read operations at the cost of storage space and maintenance overhead.

**Key Benefits:**
- 10-100x faster query performance for complex aggregations
- Reduced computational load on source tables
- Offline availability of pre-computed data

**Use Cases:**
- Dashboards with heavy aggregations
- Frequently accessed derived data
- Data caching in distributed systems
